# **Russian Roulette: The Game of Chance**
Welcome to the most thrilling game of chance you've ever played! This Python script invites you into a world where your luck is put to the test. Guess a number between 1 and 10, and if you're right, you win! If you're wrong, well... let's just say the consequences are *a bit* extreme. Perfect for those who enjoy a dash of humor with their coding!


## Overview

This Python script challenges you to guess a number between 1 and 10. If you guess correctly, you win! If not, prepare for an unexpected twist that might just make you laugh (or cry!).

## How It Works

1. The script generates a random number between 1 and 10.
2. You are prompted to guess that number.
3. If your guess is correct, you'll see a triumphant "You Won!" message.
4. If your guess is incorrect, the script humorously attempts to delete an important system file (which you definitely should not run)!

**Warning:** Running this code as-is may lead to catastrophic consequences for your operating system! This is intended purely for comedic purposes and should never be executed in a real environment.
